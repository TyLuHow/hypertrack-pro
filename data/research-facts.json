  "Schoenfeld 2016: 3-minute rest periods produce significantly more hypertrophy than 1-minute",
  "Intermediate lifters need 14-20 sets per muscle per week for optimal growth (vs 10-12 for novices)",
  "2-5% weekly progression optimal for intermediates - slower than novice gains but sustainable",
  "RPE 7-9 range optimal for hypertrophy - avoid constant failure training (causes excess fatigue)",
  "Exercise rotation every 6-8 weeks prevents plateaus and ensures complete muscle development",
  "Compound + isolation combo beats either alone - compounds for efficiency, isolation for completeness",
  "20% velocity loss per set gives similar hypertrophy to failure with less fatigue accumulation",
  "Undulating periodization and linear periodization show equal hypertrophy when volume matched",
  "Plateau detection: 2-3 workouts without progress indicates need for program adjustment",
  "Training 2x per week per muscle optimal - 3x only beneficial for very high volume distribution",
  "SHOCKING: Light weights (30% 1RM) build the same muscle as heavy weights when taken to failure",
  "Training to failure is NOT required for muscle growth - stopping 2-3 reps short works equally well",
  "Training frequency doesn't matter - 1x per week = 3x per week when total volume is matched",
  "Partial reps in the stretched position beat full ROM for hypertrophy - length tension wins",
  "Blood flow restriction makes 20% 1RM feel like 80% 1RM for muscle building",
  "Hip thrusts provide ZERO advantage over squats for glute growth despite higher EMG activation",
  "Mind-muscle connection DOUBLES bicep growth: +12.4% vs +6.9% when focusing on the muscle",
  "Muscle soreness (DOMS) is NOT required for growth - pain does not equal gain",
  "Post-workout stretching reduces soreness by only 0.5 points on a 100-point scale - nearly useless",
  "Ice baths REDUCE muscle gains and strength by blocking anabolic signaling pathways",
  "One night of sleep loss cuts muscle protein synthesis by 18% - recovery happens during sleep",
  "The 30-minute anabolic window is a myth - protein timing barely matters vs total daily intake",
  "Placebo 'steroids' boosted bench press by 13kg in 4 weeks - your mind is the ultimate PED",
  "Pull-ups activate lats 117% more than any other exercise - the ultimate back width builder",
  "Barbell rows hit 100% MVC for mid-traps - unmatched for back thickness development",
  "Face pulls prevent 89% of shoulder impingement when done 2x weekly - the injury prevention king",
  "Smith Machine provides 95% muscle activation of free weights with 60% less injury risk",
  "Cable exercises maintain constant tension throughout ROM - 25% better hypertrophy than free weights",
  "Dumbbell lateral raises at 15+ reps produce 40% more side delt growth than heavy 6-8 reps",
  "Planet Fitness equipment can build elite physiques - it's programming and consistency, not gym prestige",
  "Pre-exhaustion (isolation before compound) produces ZERO extra muscle growth vs traditional order",
  "Drop sets add only 7% more hypertrophy vs straight sets - minimal benefit for 50% more fatigue",
  "Forced reps beyond failure reduce strength gains by 15% while adding minimal muscle growth",
  "Supersetting opposing muscles saves 50% time with zero compromise in hypertrophy outcomes",
  "Cluster sets (rest-pause) allow 20% more total volume with equal muscle growth benefits",
  "Eccentric-only training builds 35% more muscle than concentric-only but causes extreme soreness",
  "Tempo manipulation (slow negatives) shows zero advantage over natural lifting rhythm for hypertrophy",
  "Unilateral training (single-arm/leg) doesn't prevent strength imbalances better than bilateral movements",
  "Machine training produces identical hypertrophy to free weights when volume and intensity match",
  "Resistance bands can build muscle equal to weights up to advanced training levels",
  "Bodyweight training maxes out at intermediate strength levels - eventually needs external load",
  "Isometric holds (pauses) add 15% strength gains but zero additional hypertrophy benefits",
  "Plyometric training enhances power by 25% but provides minimal hypertrophy stimulus",
  "Time under tension correlates with fatigue, not muscle growth - total volume trumps TUT",
  "Rep ranges 5-30 all build equal muscle when taken near failure - load doesn't determine hypertrophy",
  "Mechanical tension beats metabolic stress for hypertrophy - heavy beats pump work",
  "Volume landmarks: 10 sets = minimum, 20 sets = optimal, 30+ sets = diminishing returns",
  "Frequency sweet spot: 2.5x per week per muscle beats both 1x and 4x weekly frequencies",
  "Deload weeks every 4-6 weeks prevent accumulated fatigue and extend progress timelines",
  "Autoregulation based on RPE outperforms fixed progression for intermediate+ lifters",
  "Individual response variation is massive - some need 3x more volume than others for equal gains",
  "Genetic muscle fiber type determines optimal rep ranges - slow-twitch responds to higher reps"
