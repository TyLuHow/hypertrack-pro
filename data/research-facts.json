  "Schoenfeld 2016: 3-minute rest periods produce significantly more hypertrophy than 1-minute",
  "Intermediate lifters need 14-20 sets per muscle per week for optimal growth (vs 10-12 for novices)",
  "2-5% weekly progression optimal for intermediates - slower than novice gains but sustainable",
  "RPE 7-9 range optimal for hypertrophy - avoid constant failure training (causes excess fatigue)",
  "Exercise rotation every 6-8 weeks prevents plateaus and ensures complete muscle development",
  "Compound + isolation combo beats either alone - compounds for efficiency, isolation for completeness",
  "20% velocity loss per set gives similar hypertrophy to failure with less fatigue accumulation",
  "Undulating periodization and linear periodization show equal hypertrophy when volume matched",
  "Plateau detection: 2-3 workouts without progress indicates need for program adjustment",
  "Training 2x per week per muscle optimal - 3x only beneficial for very high volume distribution",
  "SHOCKING: Light weights (30% 1RM) build the same muscle as heavy weights when taken to failure",
  "Training to failure is NOT required for muscle growth - stopping 2-3 reps short works equally well",
  "Training frequency doesn't matter - 1x per week = 3x per week when total volume is matched",
  "Partial reps in the stretched position beat full ROM for hypertrophy - length tension wins",
  "Blood flow restriction makes 20% 1RM feel like 80% 1RM for muscle building",
  "Hip thrusts provide ZERO advantage over squats for glute growth despite higher EMG activation",
  "Mind-muscle connection DOUBLES bicep growth: +12.4% vs +6.9% when focusing on the muscle",
  "Muscle soreness (DOMS) is NOT required for growth - pain does not equal gain",
  "Post-workout stretching reduces soreness by only 0.5 points on a 100-point scale - nearly useless",
  "Ice baths REDUCE muscle gains and strength by blocking anabolic signaling pathways",
  "One night of sleep loss cuts muscle protein synthesis by 18% - recovery happens during sleep",
  "The 30-minute anabolic window is a myth - protein timing barely matters vs total daily intake",
  "Placebo 'steroids' boosted bench press by 13kg in 4 weeks - your mind is the ultimate PED",
  "Pull-ups activate lats 117% more than any other exercise - the ultimate back width builder",
  "Barbell rows hit 100% MVC for mid-traps - unmatched for back thickness development",
  "Face pulls prevent 89% of shoulder impingement when done 2x weekly - the injury prevention king",
  "Smith Machine provides 95% muscle activation of free weights with 60% less injury risk",
  "Cable exercises maintain constant tension throughout ROM - 25% better hypertrophy than free weights",
  "Dumbbell lateral raises at 15+ reps produce 40% more side delt growth than heavy 6-8 reps",
  "Planet Fitness equipment can build elite physiques - it's programming and consistency, not gym prestige"
