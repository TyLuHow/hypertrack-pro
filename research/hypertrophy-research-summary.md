# Evidence-Based Training Parameters for HyperTrack Pro

## Progressive Overload Guidelines

### By Training Experience:
- **Novices**: 5-10% weekly load increases initially, then ~5% per week
- **Intermediates**: 2-5% load increases per week or training cycle  
- **Advanced**: <2% per month, focus on volume/execution over load

### Plateau Detection:
- **Criterion**: No improvement in load OR reps for 2-3 consecutive workouts
- **Advanced monitoring**: Velocity-based training (flat/decreasing bar speed)

## Rep Range Optimization

### Effective Range:
- **Broad effectiveness**: 5-30 reps (when taken near failure)
- **Sweet spot**: 6-12 reps for efficiency
- **Double progression**: Add reps to top of range, then increase weight ~5%

## Training Volume (Evidence-Based)

### Volume Thresholds:
- **Minimum Effective Volume (MEV)**: ~10 sets per muscle per week
- **Optimal range**: 12-20 sets per week for trained individuals
- **Maximum Adaptive Volume**: ~20 sets/week (diminishing returns beyond)

### Volume by Experience:
- **Novices**: 6-8 sets/week sufficient initially
- **Intermediates**: 10-15 sets/week
- **Advanced**: 15-20+ sets/week

## Training Frequency

### Optimal Frequency:
- **2x per week**: Optimal for most muscles
- **3x per week**: Only beneficial for distributing very high volume
- **1x per week**: Suboptimal except for very low volume

## Rest Periods (Meta-Analysis Supported)

### Evidence-Based Rest Times:
- **Compound exercises**: 2-3 minutes minimum
- **Isolation exercises**: 1.5-2 minutes 
- **Heavy sets (â‰¤5 reps)**: 3 minutes
- **Avoid**: <60 seconds (compromises volume and hypertrophy)

## Exercise Selection (EMG Research)

### Top Exercises by Muscle Group:
- **Back**: Pull-ups (117% MVC lats), Barbell Rows (~90% MVC)
- **Chest**: Barbell Bench Press (~95% MVC), Dumbbell Bench, Weighted Dips
- **Shoulders**: Overhead Press (79% MVC anterior delt), Lateral Raises
- **Arms**: Barbell Curls (96% MVC biceps), Weighted Dips (triceps)

### Programming Priority:
1. **Foundation**: 1-2 compound exercises per muscle
2. **Supplement**: 1-3 isolation exercises as needed
3. **Rotation**: Change exercises every 8-12 weeks for plateau prevention

## Periodization

### Deload Protocol:
- **Frequency**: Every 4-8 weeks (6 weeks typical)
- **Method**: Reduce volume to ~50% and/or reduce loads to 60% 1RM
- **Duration**: 1 week

### Block Periodization Example:
1. **Hypertrophy Phase**: 4-6 weeks, 65-75% 1RM, 8-15 reps, high volume
2. **Strength Phase**: 3-4 weeks, 80-85% 1RM, 4-8 reps, moderate volume
3. **Deload**: 1 week between phases

## Research Sources

Based on meta-analyses and systematic reviews (2020-2024):
- Schoenfeld et al. (2019) - Volume dose-response
- Moesgaard et al. (2022) - Periodization effects  
- Baz-Valle et al. (2022) - Volume thresholds
- EMG studies for exercise selection
- Multiple meta-analyses on rest periods, frequency, rep ranges

## Implementation in HyperTrack Pro

These parameters are implemented in the app's algorithms for:
- Progressive overload calculations
- Volume recommendations  
- Rest timer settings
- Exercise selection and rotation
- Plateau detection and mitigation
- Periodization suggestions
