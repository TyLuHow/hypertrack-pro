## üìä Research Standards

HyperTrack Pro is evidence-based. When contributing research-related features:

### Research Quality

**Acceptable Sources:**
- Peer-reviewed journals
- Meta-analyses and systematic reviews
- Randomized controlled trials
- Well-designed observational studies

**Avoid:**
- Blog posts or opinion pieces
- Industry-funded studies without peer review
- Anecdotal evidence
- Outdated research (>10 years unless foundational)

### Research Integration

**When adding research facts:**

1. **Cite the source** properly
2. **Include study details** (sample size, duration, methodology)
3. **Note limitations** of the research
4. **Provide context** for practical application

**Example:**
```javascript
// Good
"Schoenfeld et al. (2016, n=21): 3-minute rest periods produced 9.8% greater hypertrophy than 1-minute rest in trained men performing multi-joint exercises"

// Avoid
"Longer rest periods build more muscle"
```

### Algorithm Development

**For training algorithms:**

1. **Base on peer-reviewed research**
2. **Document the methodology**
3. **Include confidence intervals**
4. **Test with different populations**
5. **Validate against known outcomes**

## üé® UI/UX Guidelines

### Design Principles

- **Mobile-first**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading
- **Evidence-based**: Show research backing for features

### Visual Design

- **Color scheme**: Maintain the existing dark theme
- **Typography**: Use the existing font stack
- **Icons**: Use consistent SVG icons
- **Spacing**: Follow the existing grid system

### User Experience

- **Progressive disclosure**: Show complex features when needed
- **Clear hierarchy**: Important features should be prominent
- **Feedback**: Provide clear feedback for user actions
- **Error handling**: Graceful error messages and recovery
