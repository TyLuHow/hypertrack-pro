// Tyler's Personal Workout Data - For Your Private Deployment Only
// This file contains your actual workout history
// To use this data, replace the import in index.html:
// Change: <script src="tyler-data-integration.js"></script>
// To: <script src="tyler-personal-data.js"></script>

const tylerCompleteWorkouts = [
    // Your actual workout history will go here
    // Currently empty - you can add your real workouts here for your personal deployment
    // The public demo uses demo-workouts.json instead
];

// Instructions for Tyler:
// 1. For your personal deployment: Use this file with your real workout data
// 2. For public demo: Keep using tyler-data-integration.js (which is empty)
// 3. The public repo should never contain your personal workout data
