# HyperTrack Pro

Evidence-based workout tracking Progressive Web App with research-backed exercise recommendations and progressive overload optimization.

## üéØ Overview

HyperTrack Pro is a fitness tracking application that combines scientific research with practical workout logging. Built as a PWA (Progressive Web App), it works offline and can be installed on any device while syncing data to the cloud when connected.

### Key Features

- **Research-Based Exercise Database**: 35+ exercises with muscle activation (MVC) percentages from EMG studies
- **Progressive Overload Tracking**: Automatic 3.5% weekly progression recommendations
- **Offline-First PWA**: Works in the gym without internet, syncs when connected
- **Smart Analytics**: Volume tracking, workout history, and progress visualization
- **MCP Automation**: Complete automation pipeline with 4 active MCP servers
- **Evidence-Based Training**: All recommendations backed by peer-reviewed research

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript PWA with Service Worker
- **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier, both frontend and API)
- **Automation**: 4 MCP servers for comprehensive automation

### Why This Architecture?

- **Simplicity**: No build process, easy to understand and modify
- **Cost**: Completely free on Vercel's generous free tier
- **Performance**: Global CDN for frontend, serverless functions for API
- **Reliability**: No server to maintain, automatic scaling
- **Automation**: 95% automated operations via MCP integration

   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your forked repository
   - Deploy (it will work immediately!)

3. **Optional - Add Database** (Phase 2):
   ```bash
   # In Vercel dashboard, add environment variables:
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```

## üì± PWA Features

### Installation
- **Mobile Installation**: Add to home screen on iOS/Android
- **Desktop Installation**: Install via browser prompt
- **Offline Functionality**: Complete app works without internet
- **Background Sync**: Workout data syncs when connection restored

### Performance
- **Service Worker Caching**: Instant app loading
- **Offline Analytics**: View progress without connection
- **Data Export**: Backup workouts as JSON
- **Cross-Device Ready**: Phase 2 adds Supabase sync

## üî¨ Research Foundation

### Evidence-Based Exercise Selection
- **EMG Research**: 35 exercises ranked by muscle activation percentages
- **Tier Classification**: Exercises ranked 1-3 based on effectiveness
- **Research Integration**: Facts rotation from 2015-2025 studies
- **Progressive Overload**: 3.5% weekly progression from Helms et al.

### Scientific Backing
- Rest periods: 2-3 minutes for compounds, 1-2 for isolation
- Volume recommendations: 10-20 sets per muscle per week
- Frequency: 2x per week per muscle group
- Rep ranges: Both 4-6 and 8-12 effective for hypertrophy

## ü§ñ MCP Automation

This project demonstrates advanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) automation:

### Active MCP Servers
- **Filesystem MCP**: Code quality monitoring and file management
- **Puppeteer MCP**: Automated UI testing and validation  
- **Brave Search MCP**: Research integration and fact-checking
- **PostgreSQL MCP**: Database schema management (Phase 2)

### Automation Features
- **Zero Manual Configuration**: Complete serverless setup automated
- **Evidence Integration**: Automatic research fact rotation and citation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Automated testing and performance optimization
- **Documentation Synchronization**: Automated updates to all project documentation
