# HyperTrack Pro

Evidence-based workout tracking application with progressive overload optimization and comprehensive MCP automation.

## 🎯 Current Status: Phase 1 Complete - Production Ready

**Live Demo:** https://hypertrack-pro.vercel.app

HyperTrack Pro is a fully functional Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides scientific, evidence-based workout tracking with zero ongoing costs.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Evidence-Based Training**: 35 exercises backed by EMG research with MVC activation data
- **Progressive Overload**: Automated 3.5% weekly progression based on Helms et al. research  
- **Offline Support**: Complete PWA with service worker for gym use without internet
- **Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive progress tracking with volume and frequency metrics
- **Research Integration**: Rotating research facts from 2015-2025 exercise science
- **Zero Cost**: Serverless architecture with no ongoing infrastructure expenses

## 🏗️ Architecture (Phase 1)

### Frontend (PWA)
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Modern ES6+ with no framework dependencies
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Dark/light theme with responsive design
- **Service Worker**: Offline-first caching with background sync
- **PWA Manifest**: Installable app experience on mobile devices

### Backend (Serverless)
- **Vercel Functions**: Node.js serverless API endpoints
- **RESTful API**: 4 core endpoints for exercises, workouts, recommendations, health
- **localStorage**: Phase 1 data persistence (Phase 2 will add Supabase PostgreSQL)
- **CORS Enabled**: Cross-origin requests for API integration

### Database (Current: localStorage → Future: Supabase)
- **Phase 1**: Browser localStorage with export/import functionality
- **Phase 2**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (ready for implementation)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (for development server)
- Any modern web browser
- Git

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TyLuHow/hypertrack-pro.git
